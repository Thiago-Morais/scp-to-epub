Current Objective: Avoid the Man in the White Suit, comb through the Nobody Archives to figure out his deal (and Nobody's while I'm at it). Assemble the Name Machine.

Entities of Note: Myself (past Nobodies), White Suit

Concerning Patterns:

1.  He knows me almost as well as I know myself. He is the only person to consistently track my location and my contacts. _How? Why?_
2.  Being nonexistent means I can get anywhere. It also means nobody has any clue who the fuck I am, or how to help me. Double-edged sword.

Activity Since Previous Entry:

-   Broke into Anderson High-Rise for missing part, got New Portland Airwing, Foundation FRFTS, _and_ White Suit on my ass
-   Lost White Suit in the Xyflex Parade, made my escape in a jacked hovercar
-   Met with Foundation contact for Site-30 security guard rotation schedule over waffles
-   Infiltrated Site-30 under usual disguise (they never expect the janitors)
-   Accessed SCP Foundation database for full information (seems they forgot to revoke my clearance when I stopped existingâ€¦ keep in mind)
-   Downloaded all data on GoI-195 "Nobody"

Current Status: Download complete. Now to do some reading.

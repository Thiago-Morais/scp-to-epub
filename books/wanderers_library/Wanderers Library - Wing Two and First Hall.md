# Library Wing Two

#### Second Wing: The Sea of Words

| Welcome aboard, Wanderer! Only adventurous souls in the Library venture this far from the safety of the shelves on the shore. But the Sea of Words offers a different reading experience entirely, one floating off the concepts and sentences tossed overboard by overzealous editors. A massive bright-blue sea — or lake, or ocean, nobody's quite sure — placed right in the middle of the Library. Countless dinghies, yachts, and trimarans dot the surface, along with a few larger vessels. They're all the shared property of the Library - feel free to take one out to learn its story. Under the waves, an entire world teems with life and narrative. Bookshelves lining the seabed, fish subsisting off punctuation, Librarians evolved to service those patrons (and books) that require a wetter environment. Dive in and pull out a book about the trials and tribulations of the microscopic life, or dip your own story into the waters and sea how it changes. But be careful - it might look calm and sunny now, but the weather can change in an instant. You don't want to be caught in a typephoon, do you?

## SW 0.00 - 0.99: The Dhow of Littoria's Shelf

| It has long since been sunk. The reeds wave around its prow, stroking the stern's sharp claw. But once it snarled through the ashen seas, the map's invisible lines stroking its brow, casting it along the trade routes, the coasts, the gold-dust dredged from under-coloured beaches…

## SW 1.00 - 1.99: The Shelf of Fabled Shores

| Ideas and stories have a tendency to float across the Ways until they end up drifting ashore here. Books, scrolls, and tomes of all kinds outnumber the grains of sand in this coastal area of the Library. But wanderers should be cautious, sometimes things can be washed up that were best left to the depths.

## SW 2.00 - 2.99: The Collective's Shelf

| The greatest minds were integrated into a heavy quark core and fueled by an ocean of dyson spheres to create a supreme being. It shaped the course of humanity across the universe, giving purpose to every life and perfecting our existence. There were no wars or suffering. Only peace and stillness.

## SW 3.00 - 3.99: The Captain's Shelf

| Built of the sun-bleached wood gathered from the wreck of the great library-ship of the Kharnam sea, whose captain remained nameless, dedicated only to the collection of knowledge. Inhabited by the particularly shy bees and unique flora that made the wreck their home, their jasmine and sea salt honey has spawned generations of bees. The Captain is honored through the pollinators' dedication to the upkeep of the greenery of the Library.

## SW 4.00 - 4.99: Chained Uvall's Shelf

| Hidden within the dilapidated dredges of the Pacific’s deepest depths, the Uvall has long since remained imprisoned, shackled to the ocean’s spine. For eons, he has been kept within the clouded film between life and death, caught in a balanced limbo constructed by the warlocks of Ghaelod to ensure his eternal imprisonment. Should his chains become undone, his wrath would bequeath naught but savage chaos unto the world.

## SW 5.00 - 5.99: The Lost Dreadnought's Shelf

| The veteran rests at the bottom, fallen to a war without name. Its muscles corroded by the salt, its bones crushed under the gentle weight of the barnacle. The antinomical promethean awaits in disrepair for another to reignite its lacking flame.

## SW 6.00 - 6.99: The Nameless Sailor's Shelf:

| He renounced his titles, his home, and his very name, vowing to sail the sea of words and never return until from its depths he’s hunted down a verse or poem that does not pale against his love for his lady. Should you come upon him, beware: his pen is far deadlier than his harpoon.

## SW 7.00 - 7.99: The Shelf of the Hidden Word

| No, not yet.

## SW 8.00 - 8.99: The Tyrannous Snailfish’s Shelf

| The eldritch dictator of the deepest ocean trenches, The Tyrannous Snailfish rules its wasteland domain with an iron fist, gorging itself on the flesh of its own subjects without regard. Yet not once has its reign of terror been challenged, for all it rules are feeble shellfish and worms who have taken little notice of their oppressor.

## SW 9.00 - 9.99: The Shelf of Hawig Forest

| The Ways that end among the waving fronds of Hawig Forest number in the thousands. Few find their way back once they find themselves amongst the kelp; but this is not the end, only the beginning. Many Wanderers have begun their journey lost in the forest.

# Library Hall One

#### First Hall: The Exhibition Hall

| The Library has never been limited by only the written word. Stories can be told in a variety of mediums, and the Library is not one to be picky. Here, within the liminal hallways rest the stories told through other methods - sights and sounds galore.


## EH 0.00 - 0.99: Alcove of the Seen

| Adorned with ink dripping from the walls and paint splatters on the floor, the items stored in this section of the Exhibition Hall focus on the visual senses. Sketchbooks, graphic novels, bestiaries, comics, and more line the shelves with select pieces hanging from the bookcases. Patrons are welcome to take the blank books and add their own visuals, but be warned not to sketch over another artists' works.

## EH 1.00 - 1.99: Alcove of the Heard

| Upon entering this section of the Exhibition Hall, Patrons find themselves surrounded with music and auditory stimulation. While perhaps overwhelming when first entering the Hall, Patrons can take a single work with them to enjoy the sounds in a more quiet area of the Library, or find directions to where the latest concert is happening.

## EH 2.00 - 2.99: Alcove of the Constructed

| Warping the very way the Library itself works, artists in this section of the Exhibition Hall bend space and time to their will. The familiar walls take on new coats of paint while the stories change their font and texture.

# Antimemetics Division Hub

An antimeme is _an idea with self-censoring properties_; an idea which, by its intrinsic nature, discourages or prevents people from spreading it.

**Antimemes are real.** Think of any piece of information which you wouldn't share with anybody, like passwords, taboos and dirty secrets. Or any piece of information which would be difficult to share even if you tried: complex equations, very boring passages of text, large blocks of random numbers, and dreams…

But anomalous antimemes are another matter entirely. How do you contain something you can't record or remember? How do you fight a war against an enemy with effortless, perfect camouflage, when you can never even know that you're at war?

Welcome to the Antimemetics Division.

No, this is not your first day.

_Suggested reading order is from top to bottom._

## Precursor work

These articles aren't specifically part of the main Antimemetics Division storyline above, but they influenced its development in various ways.

-   [SCP-033](/scp-033) by Mulciber. SCP-3125 has a close connection to this number.
-   [Revenants](/revenants) by [Photosynthetic](/photosynthetics-personnel-file). Like _There Is No Antimemetics Division_, this uses [SCP-055](/scp-055) as a launching point, but takes it in a different direction.
-   **[SCP-1425](/scp-1425) by Silberescher**. This was a massive influence on the writing of _[Unforgettable, That's What You Are](/unforgettable-that-s-what-you-are)_, _[Ojai](/ojai)_, and all of it really.
-   [SCP-2828](/scp-2828) by ooblex. One of the earliest antimemetic SCPs outside of SCP-055, later referenced in _[CASE COLOURLESS GREEN](/case-colourless-green)_.
-   [SCP-2358](/scp-2358) by [HotCocoaNerd](/cocoa-s-author-page). Introduces the Counterconceptual Division, later referenced several times in _What the Dead Know_.

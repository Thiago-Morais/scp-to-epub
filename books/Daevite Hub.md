## Overview

![Daeva%20Hub%20-%20Glyphs](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/grigori-karpin-s-author-page/Daeva%20Hub%20-%20Glyphs)

Derivatives of Daevic glyphs representing [SCP-2140](/scp-2140).

The Daevite Empire was an ancient civilization that began in south-central Siberia and eventually stretched throughout Central Asia, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. The Empire represented a stratified society structured around systemic slavery, military conquest through various anomalous means, ancestor worship, ritualized human sacrifice and widespread usage of thaumaturgical practices.

The history of the Daevite Empire is nebulous, and awash with mystery. Archaeological evidence supports their existence beginning circa 10,000 BCE, but the termination point of the civilization’s control over their territory varies wildly. This unclear timeline is primarily the result of [SCP-140](/scp-140), a book entitled “A Chronicle of the Daevas” which has the anomalous effect of retroactive temporal causality. Readers of the book are compelled to add additional material using any liquid, including the reader’s own blood.

![Daeva%20Hub%20-%20140%28blue%29](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/grigori-karpin-s-author-page/Daeva%20Hub%20-%20140%28blue%29)

An instance of [SCP-140](/scp-140).

With each addition to the story contained within the Chronicle, history is retroactively changed to compensate. Previous review of SCP-140 reflected that the Daevas were eventually defeated by the Chinese general Qin Kai in the third century BCE. This defeat led to the eventual genocide of all Daevas and the crumbling of the Empire. But as a result of subsequent containment breaches involving SCP-140, new material has been added which describes survivors regrouping and migrating to another region of central Siberia, rebuilding their empire steadily, and continuing to advance culturally and technologically. At present, the empire is described as having finally been crushed by Genghis Khan during the early period of his conquests, although the fates of many important persons and several cities remain ambiguous.

It is important to understand that by the very nature of SCP-140, the history of the Daeva has changed numerous times. What history we can read about the development of their Empire must be taken in scholarly skepticism, if only because of the atemporal nature of the Daevas’ cultural development.

Through the research and containment of other anomalies related to the Daevas, the Foundation has found numerous pieces of evidence that the cultural remains of this Empire have survived into modernity.

## History

## Daevite Sociological Structure

Although the Daevite Empire began as a loosely connected series of city-states with shared cultural practices and religion, the shift towards imperialism was evident from early in their history.

Unified, the Daevite Empire conquered, enslaved, and oppressed all other peoples it came into contact with.

**_Excerpt from SCP-140_**

**_The might of the Daeva military was such that no equal could stand in its way, but it was not always the behemoth it would grow to be. In the early days of the Empire, after unification and the establishment of the Ruling Council of Mothers, the fledgling Daevas formed armies made of grass children and [wooden behemoths](/scp-3140) stolen from the [Children of the Night](/scp-1000) to bolster their ranks._**

_**An early tactic was to target an enemy culture’s small farming communities, pillaging their livestock and taking many slaves; it was in this way that the Daeva learned to starve their enemies before even approaching their battlements.**_

**_It is said that rituals were performed to divine the outcome of any given battle and if the outcome was not to a Matriarch’s liking, the tactics would be changed. It was in this way that Daeva military strength became synonymous with not only overwhelming force but also unpredictable asymmetrical warfare._**

Their culture was highly stratified with an aristocratic ruling class appropriately called the Daevas. It is unclear how factual the records included in SCP-140 are, but if the book is to be believed, the Daevas were anomalous beings set apart from their nonanomalous human citizenry and slaves. It is also common to find reference to the claim that the Daevas were a divergent species from baseline humanity, with anomalously long lifespans – this is unconfirmed and smacks of propaganda, though the possibility cannot be ruled out given all their anomalous might.

Interestingly, the Daevas were strongly matriarchal, often naming their leaders as _Matriarchs_ instead of monarchs. Power was firmly vested in female political and religious leaders; often the Matriarchs served both roles.

**_Excerpt from SCP-140_**

**_It is said that one cannot see a Matriarch against her purpose. That to witness the actions of a Matriarch is to fit oneself within her plans, even if said observations go unnoticed._**

**_The Daevas were not merely given the title of Matriarch as a formality – but were in fact Mothers to all of human civilization. Childbirth is a painful, and often bloody, event hence their actions birthed the conceptual model of society into the collective unconscious._**

**_Sacrifice and birth, two primary cultural conceptions that we can trace back to the Daeva Matriarchy. For in every meaning of the word, they were our mothers._**

## Daeva Religious Practices

The following image is taken from SCP-140:

![Daeva%20Hub%20-%20Sacrifice%28a%29](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/grigori-karpin-s-author-page/Daeva%20Hub%20-%20Sacrifice%28a%29)

Detailed religious practices are hard to ascertain, but usually involved human sacrifice, smaller blood sacrifices, and even ritual cannibalism.

One consistent cultural signifier of Daevite worship we can identify is the focus on dance. From depictions in art, sections of SCP-140 (and other documents), and what testimony it is possible to gather from first hand accounts, it is clear that Daevite ritual often involves dance.

Dancing represented living, and the Daevas venerated life. From what the Historical Department has been able to find, the Daevas did not have even the concept of the afterlife. Their entire religion consisted of valuing life, the material world, and its creator. Dance was the way Daevas communicated with the originator, or as they called it, the _**Font**_. This primordial figure or _force_ is shrouded in mystery, but many have speculated this divine being was the basis for Yaldabaoth from both the Nälkä and Mekhanite myths.

At time of writing, no single Daevite work has been found that clearly defines the nature of the Font. But from interpretation of passages within SCP-140, and other archaeological finds, the Font is interpreted to be an inanimate force. A spring from which life and the material plane bubbled up from outside the universe. Pushing the primordial stuff of creation through the cracks in the shell of the universe, and injecting life into our existence. It is a source of life, rather than a creator figure.

There are no surviving devotional objects or idols that represent the Font, and none have been referred to in what information Foundation historians have been able to collect. As far as we are able to discern, the Font was less a god of life and more an abstract representation of _life itself_. There is no indication whether the Font had agency or consciousness, and arguably this would not have mattered to the Daeva. They worshipped life through the blood – the medium by which life traveled.

Excerpt from _A History of “A Chronicle of the Daeva”_ by Dr. Wentworth Sullivan:

_They danced to show the world they were alive. They danced to demonstrate their power over others. The Daeva danced to worship their gods, especially the Font, and to speak directly to them._

_Their gods only responded to two things: sacrifice and the act of dancing. The blood was to feed their gods and the dancing was to speak to them, for the gods were forever separated from their children by a metaphysical void they called_ The Nevermeant.

_The act of worshipful dancing could pierce the veil; that and the ever present shedding of blood._

---

Excerpt from _A History of “A Chronicle of the Daeva”_ by Dr. Wentworth Sullivan:

_How can we really ever know what was real or what has been created through anomalous manipulation of history? But surely, the most outlandish theories concerning the Daevite religion are formed around their worship of an entity called the Scarlet King. If such an entity even existed – and there’s no real evidence it did – there’s no link between what we concretely know about the Daeva Matriarchy and what little has been written about the Scarlet King._[\[1\]](#footnote-8254-1)

[1](#footnoteref-8254-1 "Go to note reference").  Despite Sullivan’s doubts, Foundation researchers have discovered at least one alternative universe [where this in fact was the case](/the-trashfire).

_This writer finds the concept of a matriarchal society worshiping a two dimensional patriarchal deity implausible at best, orientalist at worst._

---

## Revolution

Based on research into the [Sarkic Cults](/sarkicism-hub), the Foundation Historical Department is convinced that a widespread revolt of the slave class occurred somewhere in the period around 1800 BCE. This revolt (the details of which are mostly lost to history), led by the semi-mythic messiah figure of Grand Karcist Ion, ultimately resulted in the shifting of power around the central city state of Adytum, a previously Daeva regional capital city.

The Daevite Empire survived this event, despite the significant loss of territory and resources. Additionally, given the shifting nature of Daevite history, the accuracy of these events is hard to pin down.

It is clear such an event took place, but what grander effect it had on the Daevite Empire is difficult to ascertain. For example, no mention of the Sarkic revolt was archived in SCP-140. However, such a thing is likely to have been omitted as SCP-140 is a work authored by those with Daevite sympathies. In fact, it is surmised that the work put into creating SCP-140’s retrocausal anomalous effect was in service of changing the primary timeline such that the Daevite Empire might be preserved.

Although this begs the question: would the _Nälkä_ religion even exist without the Daeva? If the Daeva didn’t exist before the revolution – due to the retrocausal manipulation of history – would they then have inadvertently created the _Nälkä_ culture?

## Practices

## Thaumaturgy

Numerous pieces of Daevite ritual practices have been preserved into modernity. Several anomalies resulting from Daevite thaumaturgical practices have been contained by the Foundation, lending credence to the more outlandish claims made in SCP-140. \[See Articles tab\]

Daevite thaumaturgy often centered around two common practices: horticulture and blood sacrifice. Thaumaturgy was utilized to manipulate agricultural yields in various ways, including the use of anomalous trees and plant life for everyday purposes such as protection and management of bloodlines.

### Sacrifice

It was not only for religious purposes that the Daevas performed ritual killings. Daevite thaumaturgical practices, like their religious practices (often one and the same) often involved the sacrifice of human life or blood. For want of a better word, the Daevas practiced necromancy – the trading of life for power, or the thaumaturgical practice of fueling rituals with human lives. It was in this manner they modified the tree golems (see [SCP-3140](/scp-3140)) left by those they called the Children of the Night and infused clay and moss to create humanoid servants highly resistant to pain and lacking motivation of their own (see [SCP-5267](/scp-5267)).

SCP-140 itself is often powered by human blood, although any liquid that one could write with will serve. However, the creation of SCP-140’s retrocausal anomalous effect is certainly the product of human sacrifice.

**_Excerpt from SCP-140_**

_**Hence, it was in the year 7033[\[2\]](#footnote-8254-2) that the Daeva Matriarch ruling over the grand capital of Adytum performed a great working. Five hundred war slaves were sacrificed in obeisance to the Font, and after three nights, the moon turned the color of blood and the Matriarch knew her quarry had been found. In the mountains of Klipotum[\[3\]](#footnote-8254-3), the Celestial Spawn hid its tower, built to form a new army to challenge the righteous might of the Matriarch. And lo, did she send an awesome force to that citadel and defeat the fledgling army, though her quarry did escape with its child.**_

[2](#footnoteref-8254-2 "Go to note reference").  Theorized to translate to modern dating conventions circa 425 BCE.

[3](#footnoteref-8254-3 "Go to note reference").  The Urals.

Moreover, powerful ontokinetic anomalies discovered by Foundation personnel and tied to Daeva practices have been shown to work on the basis of human sacrifice. See [SCP-5626](/scp-5626).

[Recently acquired documents and artifacts](/scp-6189) have provided necessary context to hypothesized Daevite practices. Unlike a number of non-anomalous cultures, the ancient Daevites appear to have believed in a transmigration of essences – without the concept of the soul or an afterlife. The body was entirely secondary to the blood. As the blood was the medium through which all life flowed.

Essence was transposed from life to life, incarnated and fungible, but eternal singular identity was rejected. A virtuous existence – their primary virtue being one of faithful servitude to the Font, and to the physical world – was to be rewarded in this life by way of luxury and power. Their thaumaturgy reflects this, with spells and other thaumic workings often conceived as living things in themselves.

## Retrocausal Ontokinetic Anomalies

Of note are the retrocausal effects of Daevite thaumaturgical rituals. The Foundation has discovered at least two anomalies created with the purpose of retrieving victory from defeat by changing the outcomes of events. Both SCP-140 and [SCP-5711](/scp-5711) represent such rituals.

Philosophically, the Daeva had little respect for the concept of time. They viewed events as malleable in everyday life, at least for the Daevas themselves. Somehow, over their multiple millennia-spanning history, the ruling classes of the Empire were able to harness thaumaturgical rituals to rewrite events and retroactively change the results.

Whatever origins the Daeva may have had before, they have been almost certainly retrocausally erased due to their meddling with temporal thaumaturgy. This also at least partially explains the variable universes discovered where the Daeva either [continue to exist](/scp-6140) or existed in a fashion [completely differently than in baseline reality](/the-trashfire).

Excerpt from _A History of “A Chronicle of the Daeva”_ by Dr. Wentworth Sullivan:

_Amongst those scholars in the know about anomalous history, there have been some outlandish theories bandied about concerning the_ Origin of the Daevas. _I always like to point out that there is often not much we know about origins of any ancient civilization besides what can be told from the archaeological record, but if we put that aside for a moment a more terrifying reality comes into focus._

_What if, the Daeva had used their atemporal retroactive anomalous rituals so often and so early into their history, that they have completely rewritten their origins? Or more fantastically, what if the Daeva never existed in this reality at all before_ A Chronicle of the Daeva _was first published and distributed? What if the anomalous factors at play in that tome are the origins of the Daeva? Or, what if the tome is a vehicle by which the Daeva have invaded this reality, if only in retroactively rewriting history?_

Additionally, Foundation researchers have derived at least one beneficial anomaly from Daevite thaumaturgy based on retrocausal manipulation through cognitohazardous images. See [SCP-2140](/scp-2140).

## Modern Day Influences

Despite the apparent demise of the Daevite Empire, their influence has had a marked impact on modern day cultures and practices. The most obvious example of this influence is the **Ascetic Order of the Immortal Daeva**, a cult led by a mysterious figure classified as SCP-140-A, which is responsible for the production and distribution of SCP-140 instances. The Order has operated from the late 18th century to the present. SCP-140-A has been noted to appear within the content of SCP-140, but it is unclear whether this individual is a descendant of the Daeva, a survivor of the Empire, or merely a modern devotee.

Long before the Foundation began operating within the United States, the Order had influenced certain echelons of society in the US and in Europe – during the rise of occultism in the 19th century the Order performed séances, promised the elevation of the spirit and preached about the ascendancy of the body toward the divine.

Before the Order’s retreat out of the public eye[\[4\]](#footnote-8254-4), over two hundred missing persons reports were filed in connection to their operations in New York City, London, and Paris – yet no charges were ever filed. Investigations by Foundation researchers have found little direct evidence of wrongdoing or anomalous practices. The Order continues to operate a small center in Paris that is under constant surveillance. SCP-140-A is the subject of an ongoing manhunt.

[4](#footnoteref-8254-4 "Go to note reference").  Last noticeably active in 1939.

### Agricultural

Other cultural influences have survived through anomalous communities passing down Daevic agricultural techniques, such as the thaumaturgical modification of honeybees to produce arts and crafts, shape hives in the architectural style of ancient Daevic building techniques and reproduce scenes from Daevite historical annals. These bees have also been known to modify plant life to make them more susceptible to Daevic modifications for specific anomalous purposes, and encourage faster, more consistent growth, regardless of temperature and elevation.

The Daevas had a cultural focus on anomalous plant life, including developing peach trees that grew human heads to [memorialize a favorite slave of a Matriarch](/scp-392), trees that were [animate guardians with organic weaponry](/scp-3140), and trees that would [display the memories of an individual who performed a blood sacrifice](/scp-3399). The last was also capable of predicting potential mates and identifying likely genetic defects. It was in this way that the ruling Daevas maintained their bloodlines.

### Lesser Key of Solomon

The _Ars Goetia_ is a well-known grimoire written in the 1600s by an unknown author and collected into one tome with four others, entitled _Lemegeton Clavicula Salomonis_. The _Ars Goetia’s_ primary focus is on demonology and the classification of seventy-two demons. The tome denotes sigils for each of the demons named. Each sigil signifies the seal of the named demon.

![Daeva%20Hub%20-%20Goetia](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/grigori-karpin-s-author-page/Daeva%20Hub%20-%20Goetia)

Careful examination of the sigils reveal Daeva script has been adapted to form the shapes. Was this done consciously, or did the authors of the grimoire merely adapt occult symbols that had drifted down the centuries? Review of thaumaturgical histories from the Wanderers’ Library have revealed Daevite influences, and even some very rare translations of their rites. This lends credence to the theory that a significant portion of modern thaumaturgical works is based – at least in part – on Daeva practices.

### Modern Activities Attributable to Daeva Agents

In the 1990s, Site-91 in Yorkshire, England was a center for investigations into thaumaturgical and xenobiological threats to normalcy. During the investigation, a surviving Matriarch was discovered to be behind a Russian conglomerate’s expansion. In the process of attempting to locate the Matriarch and other anomalous forces she was in arms against, the staff of Site-91 discovered an abandoned Daeva stronghold in Eastern Mongolia and the process by which the Daevas created their _grass children_.

As such, [these reports concerning the investigation](/hecatoncheires-cycle-hub)[\[5\]](#footnote-8254-5) offer our greatest insight into the potential threat of an active Daevite force on the Foundation’s attempts to maintain normalcy.

[5](#footnoteref-8254-5 "Go to note reference").  Designated Project Hecatoncheires.

---

The Daeva were effectively the first civilization, even earlier than Ur or Sumer, and the influence of their activities on modern cultures cannot be discounted. But it is the Daevas’ inability to completely fade into history that makes them relevant for Foundation research. Whether retrocausal, ontokinetic, or the anomalous manipulation of plant life, the Daeva are a consistent aspect of the anomalous world. They touched every major anomalous group that dates to antiquity and the reverberations of their actions continue to surface. Personnel are to remain vigilant for any sign of Daevite anomalies, as we do not know if the “dawn” promised by SCP-140-A’s cult is an aspirational goal or precognitive warning.

All of the Foundation’s study of the Daevas began with the discovery and containment of this book. If SCP-140 comes into contact with any fluid suitable for writing, including human blood, the account of the Daevite civilization’s history expands. Human blood appears the most “potent” of possible writing substances, but in any case, the amount of new material does not correspond proportionately to the fluids introduced. Reality is retrocausally changed as additions are made.

Peach tree that produces a series of physically identical male human heads. DNA analysis indicates that they are of the same individual. As the tattoos found on the heads are indicative of human concubine belonging to Daevite matriarchs, it is postulated that the heads grown from SCP-392 represent a human concubine of a specific Daeva Matriarch.

-   **[SCP-3399](/scp-3399)** – _**Family Tree**_ by [Mortos](http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/mortos)

Trees that grow leaves which play out memories when activated by a blood sacrifice. The leave will predict future events, specifically those individuals likely to provide a good pairing for procreation; additionally, the leaves will identify possible genetic defects in potential offspring of the pairing. Researchers believe the anomaly was used to manipulate bloodlines in ruling Daeva families.

A species of honeybee adapted by the Daevas to survive colder weather, producing large hives with advanced architecture – similar to Daevite temples or other culturally significant buildings. Only manual labor and SCP-5280 are able to successfully pollinate anomalous Daevite plants. The bees in the article change a group of bushes into a “_singular, expansive scene, consisting of multiple humanoid figures and buildings. Figures are divided into two groups: Daeva (who are in various poses of distress) and soldiers (who are attacking the Daeva)._”

-   **[SCP-5297](/scp-5297)** – **_JamBomb_** by [DodoDevil](http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dododevil)

A series of thaumaturgic glyphs of suspected Daevite origin. In their original intended use, these glyphs would have been engraved into the bark of fruit trees as a component of an arbormantic ritual. Upon completion, the growth of fruit upon these trees would be greatly accelerated and uncharacteristically resistant to various parasitic creatures and potential ailments.

-   **[SCP-5711](/scp-5711)** – _**Threat Level: MIDNIGHT**_ by [HammerMaiden](http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/hammermaiden)

SCP-5711 is a thaumaturgic ritual capable of altering the course of historical events without direct intervention by traditional temporal displacement methodology. Recovered materials from SCP-5711-1 suggest that the ritual and the apparatus involved in its completion were developed by the Daevite Civilization as recently as 250 - 200 BCE.

This proposal serves as an origin story for the modern Church of the Broken God and so isn’t really about the Daevas, but they are a significant antagonist in the story so this is warranted as an inclusion.

This time, the Daeva are front and center, with a very new and very unique interpretation of the ancient society inspired by the actual word daeva as it exists in history. Layered within are numerous references to other established ideas concerning the Daeva, but with Rounder's unique twist on it. Rich world building and a tense narrative are the stars of the show, but at its core this is a deeply cultural story about the Daeva and how they continue to touch the present despite their long ago destruction.

The Daevas were always thought of as an evil empire, enslaving everyone who was not Daeva. However, this all changed when a tablet was discovered in Lothal, a “Charter of Emancipation” by a Daevic potnya.

-   **[The Trashfire](/the-trashfire)** by various authors, but primarily [UraniumEmpire](http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/uraniumempire)

Presenting a different take from the centralized concepts of Daevites on the Wiki, but still very important for the understanding of this ancient people.

SUMMARY

The Trashfire primarily follows the fallout caused by the "Old Gods", and very specifically the four worshiped by the Daevite Empire:

-   The Verdant Mage, a vast and mindless entity of fire and poison;
-   The Scarlet King, the aquatic eunuch lord of violence and hierarchy;
-   The Violet Queen, a screeching horror associated with glittering corruption, ursurpation, and insects; and
-   "That which makes holes in the shapes of worms", a vicious antimeme known through negative space.

The Daevites, and by extension the Old Gods, were opposed by the Imit, a culture of clay humanoids ingrained with knowledge of thaumaturgy by their former slavemasters, _Homo sapiens decensus_. What started as Daevite expansion into Imit territory turned into an existential battle that nearly exterminated the Imit, yet irreparably damaged the influence of the Old Gods on Earth.

### Writing about the Daevas

So, you wanna write about the Daevas, huh?

Good! You’ve come to the right place.

In terms of limitations, there really aren’t any. The Trashfire and SCP-6140 are wildly different than the original understanding of the Daeva as mentioned in SCP-140, so the lore is pretty loose. And by the very nature of the Daeva being timey-wimey blood thaumaturges, almost anything is feasible. I think the one thing that is universal is the Daeva were a slave-built imperialist empire, at least in antiquity.

Making them out to be noble is gonna be hard, given they enslaved everyone around them and even inspired the formation of Sarkicism as a religion in the form of a revolt that decimated their society.

BUT basically, whatever you want to write is up to you, the standards are what they’ve always been: upvoted or not. My suggestion is to read through some of the linked articles and the hub itself (which includes information that is nowhere else) and try to respect it or subvert it. The Daeva were made originally by [AssertiveRoland](http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/assertiveroland) but they’ve expanded since SCP-140 and much like the rest of the wiki, they’ve mutated under the constant threat of collaborative fiction.

Feel free to message me ([Grigori Karpin](http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/grigori-karpin)) or consider reaching out to one of the authors of the notable articles!

### Adding to the Hub

Please feel free to add your articles to the hub, as long as they are significantly about Daeva. The reason for making this hub so many years after SCP-140 was that when you click on the _daevite_ tag many articles come up, but after having read through all the SCPs, I noticed that most weren’t really about the Daeva, having instead a single line of content mentioning them.

If you have any concerns, message me on Discord or here on wikidot ([Grigori Karpin](http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/grigori-karpin)).

# Algorithm Curated Recommendations

Welcome to the SCP wiki algorithm curated recommendations, here we have used the GoodBoy AI to provide a selection of stories for new readers and for readers who want an introduction to a particular section of this website, be it a type of SCP, a group of interest or a canon.

Do note that there is some redundancy between different sections as this is meant to be an introduction to different sections of the wiki.

Don't be overwhelmed by everything on here, find something that interests you and go from there.

For genre based lists please check out [user curated lists](/user-curated-lists) and [curated tales series](/curated-tale-series). Sadly the AI is not great at picking up on nuances like genre.

[So how does this work exactly, may contain traces of math](javascript:;)

[– hide block](javascript:;)

What is going on behind the selection for these lists is a little complicated. An AI is effectively predicting the likelihood of a theoretical average user upvoting an article. I am then sorting all articles with a tag by how likely said average user is to upvote, and taking the 10 best articles from that. This does have a bias towards highly upvoted articles due to the algorithm being more certain that they are liked, although this is not the case for articles with more than 10% downvotes, which is why some very highly upvoted things are not on these lists.

The full details of the actual math behind this should go up on SCP declassified at some point.

# Canons

While the SCP wiki does not have a central canon, we do have a bunch of smaller canons each with their own feel.

For this I would recommend looking at the hubs for these canons if you like what you read here, see the [Canon hub page](/canon-hub), some descriptions have been taken from there.

## End of Death

Death is the promise that all of the hardships we face will, at some point, come to an end. But what if death did not keep its promise? If the hardships just kept coming? We would have no choice but to persevere through them. Forever.

As the world becomes more and more magical and wondrous, the Foundation must change its ways towards acceptance and collaboration. Unless it wants to let the world surrender to the fallout of the Three Great Diasporas, the possibly resurgent Fae Empire, and its god-like ruler, Queen Mab, it must finally make a move, in a collaborative effort to change the world for the better.

## Site-17 Deepwell Catalog

People come to power. Other people get hurt. It doesn't matter if it belongs to a conceptual embodiment or a Site Director, power seems to breed injury at Site-17, and people have started to notice. Old structures are groaning beneath the weight of their antiquity, and it's up to a few researchers and SCPs to survive the coming crash.

## RECOVERED INTELLIGENCE

**Manufactured Intel**

Summary: A collection of recovered intelligence

summaries on "the Factory", each from separate sources

which contradict the others, at least partially.

Possibly an intentional disinformation campaign?

It would have to be by "the Factory", because if it was by

anyone else, it likely would've been applied to others.

Threat: Med. Potentially applies to other things.

Interest: Effect could be repurposed by myself to gain

time if people get too much information on me.

I'd need to infiltrate an outpost to get more information,

which would be far more dangerous than a lot of

what i've done already. If possible, consider placing an order?

It could lower aggression, but I'd lose the element of surprise.

Problems: Information gathered on other topics might not be accurate,

and I don't know what the source of this anomaly is.

### The Factory

The Factory is a poorly-understood entity or group of entities of indeterminate origin stationed primarily in the midwestern U.S. and several countries with poor labor laws. It's reported to have been founded in 1835 by UTE-0561-Venice Green, whose current location is unknown. Its management is comprised of ostensibly sapient entities which have yet to be satisfactorily described or photographed.

**Structure:** No definitive information is available regarding their internal organization at this time. It is believed that the Factory operates loosely corresponding with similar non-anomalous corporations.

**Resources:** The Factory appears to be self-funded through the sales of various mass-produced anomalies.

**Standing Orders:** Engage as soon as possible. Operatives of the Factory are to be considered KTEs, Response Level 3 by default, 4 if actively aggressive.

_**Of the Robber Barons**_

_Into a new world the Barons creep,  
And as her workers slowly weep,  
Fuel is drained from limbs and blood,  
Her vision of this world is stained by mud,  
Walls built in err of their time,  
And bricks wrought of sin and grime._

The Robber Barons are believed to be a trans-universal concept which maintains great difficulty in movement between realities1. The first recorded appearance of the Robber Barons was in Γ-7382, year 5720 EV, in which the Barons manifested as a small restaurant which did not sell food2. From Γ-7382, the Barons slowly infected further universes with no known pattern, with the sole exception that expansion takes between 500-2000 years.

In all known incarnations, the Robber Barons appear as a twisted and corrupted amalgamation of recent successful businesses and organizations3. The Barons are tended to and managed by Foremen, who are equally a corrupted amalgamation of business magnates and managers. In every incarnation of its form, the Barons hire their workers from the local populace with promises of their needs being taken care of by the company.

Her workers are abandoned after they submit to the Barons, and are left to be torn apart by the rusted contraptions without intervention from their superiors. In its present form, the Barons rely on outside sources for raw materials which are assembled by man and machine alike on conveyor belts.

_"Recovered subjects displayed no physical anomalies, though both physical and mental health showed signs of significant bodily damage of non-anomalous origin, primarily occurring through smoke inhalation and physical trauma sustained via the Factory's various machines. Subjects are kept in the Site-32 hospital."_ —Medical journal of Heather Michael, SCP Foundation

1: As inferred from texts concerning universes Γ-7382 through Σ-0214.  
2: More information concerning the Factory's recorded origins can be found in _Aunt Sherira's Diner, A History_.

## EVENT DOCUMENT TEMPLATE

EVENT NAME:

FACTORY  
(EST. 1835)

Event names should effectively summarize what transpired without providing detail. Event names can be displayed with or without all-caps.  
It's important to note that if you aren't using all-caps, the first letter of every word should be capitalized. This applies to all sections until otherwise specified.  
It should also be noted that periods should not be used either, until otherwise specified.  
The grey bar on the side will have to be altered to fit the amount of rows present in the Event Report. To do this change "rowspan = '#'" from the first cell code to the correct amount.

EVENT ID:

Event IDs are formatted as the first letter in the most relevant word followed by a dash and an arbitrary five-digit numerical designation.  
For example, a format regarding [corporate sabotage might be ID'd as "S-14919"](corporate-sabotage-14919)

IMPORTANCE:

Low/Medium/High \[CHOOSE ONE\]

LOCATION:

Area that the event took place in. Generally speaking, Factory formats focus on events that occur in their factories, though other locations can be used.  
Factory-owned areas are designated by stating the compass direction and the country/county/state the Factory is in, followed by what purpose the building serves. E.G. "Northwestern Idaho Manufacturing Center".[\[1\]](#footnote-728c-1)

DATE:

The day in which the event occurred.  
Formatted as M D, Y, with the month written as a word, the day, written using digits, followed by that number's placement suffix, and the year written using digits. E.G. "January 5th, 1969".

PRIMARY ACTOR(S):

-   The non-Factory individuals that are directly involved
-   Formatted using bullet points, regardless of the number of actors
-   This section should be devoid of periods
-   Individuals should be listed using the format of "Group that they work for, and then their name, such as the example below"
-   SCP Foundation Employee George Georgerson
-   If no actors can be identified, feel free to say that they're unknown

PRIMARY FACTORY ACTOR:

The person or thing that participated the most in the event. Make sure you specify their position before their name. E.G. "Intern Margaret Weirdname"[\[2\]](#footnote-728c-2)

[2](#footnoteref-728c-2 "Go to note reference").  Worker IDs are formatted similarly to the location IDs. The first three-to-five letters of their job position (sometimes including initials in multi-word job names) followed by an arbitrary eight-digit numerical designation. Using the example as a jumping off point, the ID would be "Worker ID: INT02937435".

OTHER PARTICIPATING FACTORY ACTORS:

-   Formatted in the same manner as the Primary Actors section, but with Factory employees. In the description, trigger, and order of events, the story proper takes place. The sections up until now have been largely setup.

OTHER AFFECTED STAKEHOLDERS:

-   Any groups that would logically be affected by the event
-   Can include Factory customers, Factory stockholders, and specific named groups, companies, and/or individuals

RELEVANT PRIOR INFORMATION:

\[PERIODS ARE USED FROM THIS POINT FORWARDS | FIRST-LETTER CAPITALIZATION IS NOT USED FROM THIS POINT FORWARDS\]  
Exactly what it sounds like. Any information that would influence the event or help the reader to understand what's going on.

DESCRIPTION:

A short summary of the order of events section. A short description of the trigger is allowed, but not necessary. In the description, trigger, and order of events, the story proper takes place. The sections up until now have been largely setup.

TRIGGER:

A short or somewhat detailed explanation of what occurred to cause the event. Dialogue may be present and should be formatted either in a quote block (As shown below)[\[3\]](#footnote-728c-3).

[3](#footnoteref-728c-3 "Go to note reference").

> Or in a quote block, _in a footnote!_

> Quote block
>
> \-Person quoted, formatting in the same way as the primary actors section, sans bullet point.

ORDER OF EVENTS

**Actor Action**

**Factory Response**

The outside actor(s)' action summarized.[\[4\]](#footnote-728c-4)[\[5\]](#footnote-728c-5)

[4](#footnoteref-728c-4 "Go to note reference").  Footnotes may be used to provide context or flavor in the form of dialogue, formatted in the same way as shown in the trigger section.

[5](#footnoteref-728c-5 "Go to note reference").  Multiple footnotes may be used in situations where multiple persons are talking.

Factory response. Rules are the same as the outsider's section.

As shown on the left, you can leave sections blank if either party does not respond to an action of the other.

It works on either side!

Repeat as necessary.

TEXT

RESULTS/FOLLOW UP

A short section describing the aftermath of the event and what the Factory did afterwards.

[1](#footnoteref-728c-1 "Go to note reference").  The footnote of this section lists the Location ID, which is formatted as the initials following the geographical location, and further followed by an arbitrary seven-digit numerical designation. Finally, the two to three initials of the compass direction and the first initial of the country/county/state are used. Using the previous example as the jumping off point, the location ID would be "Location ID: MC-8456493-NWI".
